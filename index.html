            <h3>Who I am:</h3>
             <p>Hello, name is Charlie. I'm currently a student with Thinkful Coding Bootcamp.</p>
            <h3>Where I'm located:</h3>
              <p>I'm currently located in Austin, TX.</p>
            <h3>What about the above photo?!</h3>
              <p>You might be wondering, is the above photo from Austin?
              <br>I actually took that photo on my vacation in Iceland last year.
              <br>Hopefully, once I progress in the course, I can design 
              <br>this website to be a digital collage of my travel photographs. 
             </p>

          <h2>About Me</h2>
          </header>
              <h3>Why software development?</h3>
                <p>Iâ€™ve always loved the satisfaction of solving problems, being creative, 
	          <br>and designing or creating something. At its core level, software/web development 
		        <br>allows for multiple possibilities to solve a problem, in unique and creative ways.
		        <br>Being able to work with others, towards a common goal, is a very rewarding experience.</p>
